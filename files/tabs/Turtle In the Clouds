 NOTES: "WALA"  Though there is no official transcript of lyrics available, and going solely on 20+yrs as a crazy phan (meaning my theory is most likely incorrect) I believe the band is going for irony/whimsical play here.
 Seeing how a clueless person could think wala or walah rather than the proper voila.
